Here's a detailed review and documentation for the provided `docker-compose.yaml` file:

# **Docker Compose Configuration for GPROX**

This `docker-compose.yaml` file is designed to deploy the GPROX service in a containerized environment. It includes options for integrating with Traefik as a reverse proxy, using an external Docker network, and securely mounting configuration files.

---

## **Review and Suggestions**

### **Strengths**
1. **Traefik Integration**:
   - Labels provide robust integration with Traefik for both HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
   - Automatic redirection from HTTP to HTTPS is handled via middleware.

2. **Secure Configuration**:
   - Mounts configuration (`config.yaml`) and service account (`gcloud.json`) files as read-only volumes to prevent unauthorized modification.

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Uses `GPROX_CONFIG_PATH` to ensure the container can locate the configuration file.

4. **Restart Policy**:
   - Includes a `restart: unless-stopped` directive for automatic recovery of the container.

5. **Customizable Network**:
   - Uses an external network (`web`), enabling seamless integration with other services.

---

### **Recommendations**
1. **Clarify `HOST.example.com`**:
   - Replace `HOST.example.com` with a placeholder or explain that users must customize this value.

2. **Expose HTTP Ports Only If Necessary**:
   - Ensure that the commented-out `ports` directive is removed entirely if Traefik is always used, to avoid confusion.

3. **Document Traefik Middleware**:
   - Explain the purpose of each Traefik label, especially the custom headers and redirect middleware.

4. **Service Account Security**:
   - Highlight the importance of restricting access to `gcloud.json` outside of the container.

5. **Environment Variables**:
   - Document how additional environment variables can be added if needed in the future.

## **Documentation for `docker-compose.yaml`**

### **Purpose**
This file defines the deployment of GPROX in a containerized environment, enabling:
- Management of DNS TXT records for ACME challenges.
- Integration with Traefik for secure HTTPS routing.

---

### **Key Sections**

#### **1. Service: `gprox`**
This section defines the GPROX container.

- **Build Context**:
  - Assumes the `Dockerfile` is in the current directory (`.`).
  
- **Container Name**:
  - Names the container `gprox` for easy identification.

- **Environment Variables**:
  - `GPROX_CONFIG_PATH`: Specifies the location of the `config.yaml` file inside the container.

- **Volumes**:
  - Mounts:
    - `config.yaml`: The GPROX configuration file (read-only).
    - `gcloud.json`: Google Cloud service account JSON (read-only).

- **Restart Policy**:
  - Ensures the container restarts automatically unless explicitly stopped.

- **Networks**:
  - Connects the container to the `web` network for Traefik integration.

---

#### **2. Traefik Integration**
Traefik labels define the routing rules and middleware.

- **HTTP Router**:
  - Redirects traffic from HTTP to HTTPS using middleware.

- **HTTPS Router**:
  - Handles secure traffic using a Let's Encrypt certificate resolver.

- **Service Definition**:
  - Specifies the container's internal port (`8080`) for Traefik to forward requests.

- **Custom Headers**:
  - Ensures that the container receives headers indicating HTTPS traffic when routed through Traefik.

---

#### **3. External Network**
- **`web` Network**:
  - Uses an external Docker network for communication with other services and the reverse proxy.

---

### **Example Usage**

#### **Start the Container**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### **Check Logs**
```bash
docker logs gprox
```

#### **Stop the Container**
```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

### **Sample Customization**

#### **Update Hostname**
Replace `HOST.example.com` with your desired domain:
```yaml
- "traefik.http.routers.gprox-http.rule=Host(`mydnsproxy.example.com`)"
- "traefik.http.routers.gprox.rule=Host(`mydnsproxy.example.com`)"
```

#### **Add More Managed Zones**
Update the `config.yaml` file to add additional managed zones:
```yaml
managed_zones:
  example-com: example.com
  subdomain-example-com: sub.example.com
```

#### **Add API Key**
Add a new API key to the `config.yaml` file:
```yaml
api_keys:
  - "new-key-user3"
```

---

### **Security Considerations**

- **Service Account**:
  - Ensure `gcloud.json` has restricted permissions on the host (`chmod 600`).
  
- **Traefik Headers**:
  - The custom headers (`X-Forwarded-*`) indicate secure traffic to the application. Ensure Traefik is configured correctly to avoid exposing these headers.

- **Public Access**:
  - If the GPROX container is exposed without Traefik, ensure API keys are rotated regularly and access is restricted to trusted clients.
