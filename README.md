# **GPROX: An ACME DNS Proxy for Google Cloud DNS**

GPROX is a lightweight ACME DNS proxy specifically designed to work seamlessly with [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns) and [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh). The primary goal is to enable DNS challenges for generating universally recognized SSL certificates, especially for systems like Synology NAS, where the built-in Let’s Encrypt method does not support DNS challenges.

---

## **Purpose**

This project was created to overcome the limitations of Synology’s built-in SSL certificate provisioning system. While tools like `dns_acmeproxy.sh` exist, configuration challenges and compatibility issues led to the creation of GPROX, a tailored solution for working with Google Cloud DNS and supporting Synology DSM.

GPROX acts as a secure intermediary between `acme.sh` and Google Cloud DNS, facilitating DNS-based validation for SSL certificates in an efficient, reliable, and customizable manner.

---

## **Key Features**

- **ACME DNS Challenge Proxy**:
  - Handles DNS challenges required by Let’s Encrypt for SSL certificate issuance.
  - Compatible with `acme.sh`'s DNS API.

- **Google Cloud DNS Integration**:
  - Directly interacts with Google Cloud DNS using service account credentials.
  - Automates TXT record creation and deletion.

- **API Security**:
  - API key authentication ensures secure access.
  - Designed to run behind reverse proxies like Traefik.

- **Lightweight and Flexible**:
  - Built with Flask, leveraging Docker for portability and simplicity.
  - Configurable via YAML for custom domains, TTL, and API key management.

- **Extensible**:
  - Built with simplicity in mind, allowing contributors to add features like rate limiting, IP whitelisting, and more.

---

## **Project Components**

### **1. `gprox.py`**
The core API written in Python using Flask. It provides endpoints for managing DNS TXT records for ACME challenges.

- **Key Endpoints**:
  - `POST /v1/dns/add`: Add a TXT record.
  - `POST /v1/dns/remove`: Remove a TXT record.
  - `GET /v1/health`: Check API health.

### Service Account Key (`gcloud.json`)
The `gcloud.json` file contains the credentials for a Google Cloud service account with permissions to manage Cloud DNS. Ensure the service account has the `roles/dns.admin` role and securely store the JSON file. For detailed instructions on creating this file, see the [gcloud.json.md](gcloud.json.md) guide.

 
- **Highlights**:
  - Validates API keys before processing requests.
  - Parses Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) to determine the correct Google Cloud DNS managed zone.
  - Uses Google Cloud DNS APIs to handle DNS record operations.

### **2. `dns_gprox.sh`**
A custom DNS API script for `acme.sh` to interact with GPROX.

- **Usage**:
  - Add a TXT record: `dns_gprox_add`.
  - Remove a TXT record: `dns_gprox_rm`.
  
- **Configuration**:
  - Requires `GPROX_ENDPOINT` and `GPROX_API_KEY` as environment variables.

### **3. `acmerenew.sh`**
A helper script for automating SSL certificate renewal and deployment.

- **Features**:
  - Leverages `acme.sh` for certificate renewal.
  - Deploys renewed certificates to Synology DSM via the `synology_dsm` deploy hook.

## **Getting Started**
### Getting Started



### **1. Prerequisites**
- A Google Cloud project with DNS API enabled.
- A service account with `roles/dns.admin` permissions.
- Synology DSM with SSH enabled (optional, for initial setup).
- Docker installed for running GPROX.

### **2. Installation**

#### **Deploy GPROX**
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t gprox .
   ```
3. Configure the `config.yaml` file with your managed zones, API keys, and other settings. See the example file included in this repository for details.
4. Create a service account and download the corresponding `gcloud.json` file. Refer to the [gcloud.json.md](gcloud.json.md) guide for instructions.

5. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name gprox -p 8080:8080 \
     -v /path/to/config.yaml:/etc/gprox/config.yaml \
     gprox
   ```

#### **Install `acme.sh`**
1. Install `acme.sh`:
   ```bash
   curl https://get.acme.sh | sh
   ```
2. Copy `dns_gprox.sh` to the `dnsapi` directory of `acme.sh`:
   ```bash
   cp /path/to/dns_gprox.sh ~/.acme.sh/dnsapi/
   ```

#### **Configure Synology DSM** *(Optional)*
1. Follow the instructions in `acmerenew.sh` to add your domain.
2. Schedule a task to renew and deploy certificates.

---

## **Configuration**

The `config.yaml` file is the heart of GPROX. Below is an example:

### Managed Zones
The `managed_zones` in `config.yaml` define the DNS zones that the proxy is allowed to modify. This acts as an additional security layer to ensure no unauthorized DNS zones are accessed. For example:
```yaml
managed_zones:
  example-com: example.com
  anotherexample-example-com: anotherexample.example.com


```yaml
log_level: "INFO"
gcloud_service_account: "/path/to/service_account.json"
gcloud_project: "your-google-cloud-project-id"
managed_zones:
  example-zone: "example.com."
  another-zone: "another.com."
api_keys:
  - "your-api-key"
ttl: 300
```

- **`log_level`**: Adjust logging verbosity (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `ERROR`).
- **`gcloud_service_account`**: Path to your Google Cloud service account JSON file.
- **`gcloud_project`**: Google Cloud project ID.
- **`managed_zones`**: Define your DNS managed zones.
- **`api_keys`**: List of valid API keys for authenticating requests.

---

## **Usage**

### **1. Issue a Certificate**
Run `acme.sh` with the `dns_gprox` DNS API:
```bash
acme.sh --server letsencrypt --issue -d "example.com" --dns dns_gprox
```

### **2. Deploy to Synology DSM**
Deploy the certificate using the `synology_dsm` deploy hook:
```bash
acme.sh --deploy -d "example.com" --deploy-hook synology_dsm
```

### **3. Renew Certificates**
Automate renewal and deployment using `acmerenew.sh` in a scheduled task.

## **Security Considerations**

- **API Key Management**:
  - Rotate API keys regularly.
  - Use unique keys for each user.

### API Keys
- **Management**: API keys are defined in `config.yaml`. Use a consistent format for keys that includes the purpose or user (e.g., `<key>_<user>`).
- **Logging Behavior**: API keys are logged when used, allowing traceability. Avoid using sensitive identifiers in key names.

  
- **Service Account Security**:
  - Limit permissions to only DNS operations (`roles/dns.admin`).
  - Restrict access to the service account file.

- **Rate Limiting and IP Restrictions**:
  - Consider implementing rate limiting or IP whitelisting for additional security.

- **HTTPS**:
  - Run GPROX behind a reverse proxy like Traefik for SSL termination.

### Debugging
If issues arise during certificate issuance or deployment, use the `--debug` flag with `acme.sh` for verbose logging:
```bash
./acme.sh --issue -d example.com --dns dns_gprox --debug
```

## **Contributing**

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for features like rate limiting or IP whitelisting, please open an issue or submit a pull request. For major changes, reach out to discuss the design.

### Security Considerations
- **API Key Management**:
  - Rotate API keys periodically to minimize security risks.
- **Service Account Security**:
  - Regularly review and rotate service account credentials.
  - Limit the service account’s permissions to only what is necessary (e.g., `roles/dns.admin`).
